		<p>
			A Montana local instilled with a hard work ethic and
			a passion for adventure. I am passionate about everything
			outdoors or near water. Often I'm getting dirty with my hands 
			and trying to bringing back of the napkin designs to reality. 
			My interests prompted me to pursue a degree in Chemistry to 
			further my life-time goal of becoming an opthamologis. I 
			focused my entire undergraduate degree on applying the concepts 
			of what I was taught to fundamental principles around the 
			developtment and detection of defects within the eye. 
		</p>
		<p>
			While in school I remained focused towards my goal and met 
			with many professors to share my ideas with. They all were 
			suprised and immediately extended their interests. As time went 
			on, I was able to digest my own ideas and realized that I truely 
			love learning everything that has an edge of mystery to it and 
			decided to take the mcat and apply for medschool in Washington.
		</p>
		<p>
			I strive to channel my energy and drive too helping others and 
			finding the joys that the world has to offer. I pride myself on 
			making others feel welcome and loved, so that growth is without 
			loss, and life-long goals are reached.
